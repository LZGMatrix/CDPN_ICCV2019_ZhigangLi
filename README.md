# CDPN: Coordinates-based Disentangled Pose Network for Real-time RGB-based 6-DoF Object Pose Estimation
6-DoF object pose estimation from a single RGB image is a fundamental and long-standing problem in computer vision. Current leading approaches solve it by training deep networks to either regress both rotation and translation from image directly or to construct 2D-3D correspondences and further solve them via PnP indirectly. We argue that rotation and translation should be treated differently for their significant difference. In this work, we propose a novel 6-DoF pose estimation approach: Coordinates-based Disentangled Pose Network (CDPN), which disentangles the pose to predict rotation and translation separately to achieve highly accurate and robust pose estimation. Our method is flexible, efficient, highly accurate and can deal with texture-less and occluded objects. Extensive experiments on LINEMOD and Occlusion datasets are conducted and demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Concretely, our approach significantly exceeds the state-of-theart RGB-based methods on commonly used metrics.

## Prepare the dataset

1. Download training and test data of LINEMOD dataset:
   - The OpenGL training data can be found [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1QFGI4QQK5EEsnPSu2rk-aA) (password: b7kt).
   - The real training  data can be found [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1WCM5VU6n5_OhMUNhHq5CCw) (password: sesw).
   - The test data can be found [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/18wn7wMRFQLWM2hkNillaCg) (password: mhko).
   - The 3D object models can be found [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1DyeUPUw_ePisDUij-4LC_Q) (password: ba4f).
2. Download VOC2012 dataset from official website (http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/index.html).

   Note: The VOC2012 is only used as background data, which can also be replaced with other real-world datasets such as MS COCO dataset, SUN datset, and so on.

3. Prepare the dataset as follows:

```

```


## Training

### 1. Stage 1:

- cd tools; and run:

```
sh train_stage1.sh
```
### 2. Stage 2:

- Edit the config file of stage 2 in path ./tools/exps_cfg/config_trans.yaml:

  > ​	Replace the 'path to the trained model of step1' with your actual path.

-	cd tools; and run:
```
sh train_stage2.sh
```
### 3. Stage 3:

- Edit the config file of stage 3 in path ./tools/exps_cfg/config_rot_trans.yaml:

  > ​	Replace the 'path to the trained model of step2' with your actual path.

- cd tools; and run:

```
sh train_stage3.sh
```
## Testing

For testing various models trained in stage1, stage2 and stage3:

1. Edit the config file by: 
   - Setting the "test" from False to True.
   - Setting the "load_model" with path of the testing model.
2. cd tools; and run:


```
python main.py --cfg=exps_cfg/path_to_your_config_file.yaml
```
